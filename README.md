Simple slf4j api implementation for GWT
=========

The aim of this project is to provide developers with an implementation
of the [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J 1.7.5)](http://www.slf4j.org/) API for the GWT client side. Right now the project provides
the basic SLF4J API and an implementation of the API using the java.util.logging (JUL)
logging framework supported since GWT 2.1.
